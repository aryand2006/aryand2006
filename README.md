### About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, driven by curiosity and a passion for systems that interact with the real world. I specialize in:

- **LLM Systems**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent orchestration, verification pipelines
- **Financial Engineering**: Live ML-driven trading systems, portfolio optimization
- **Cross-Paradigm Development**: Building the same system in multiple languages to explore design tradeoffs
- **Browser/UI Design**: Interfaces that reduce friction, distraction, and overload

<p>When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m always up for a good chess match, most sports (swimming, running, hiking, mini golf, rock climbing, badminton, table tennis, skiing), and any opportunity to innovate and collaborate.</p>
