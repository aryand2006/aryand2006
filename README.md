### About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University, focused on building AI systems that interact with real-world data. My work spans:

- LLM engineering: RAG pipelines, agent orchestration, retrieval verification
- ML in finance: live trading systems and portfolio optimization
- Systems design: building across languages to analyze tradeoffs
- Human-computer interaction: clean, responsive interfaces for high-cognitive-load workflows
